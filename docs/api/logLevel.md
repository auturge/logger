<h1 align="center">LogLevel</h1>

> `LogLevel`: Defines the default set of logging severity levels.

Any `LogLevel` exposes the following members:

- [`level`](#level)
- [`name`](#name)
- [`displayName`](#displayName)

`LogLevel` also exposes several enum-like static [`LogLevels`](#log-levels):

- [`OFF`](#log-levels)
- [`FATAL`](#log-levels)
- [`ERROR`](#log-levels)
- [`WARN`](#log-levels)
- [`INFO`](#log-levels)
- [`DEBUG`](#log-levels)
- [`TRACE`](#log-levels)
- [`ALL`](#log-levels)

See also the table of [log levels](#log-levels).
